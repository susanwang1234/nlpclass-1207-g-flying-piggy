      "first first i thought i wanted wanted to to . \n",
      "so after we 've seen a couple of these buildings -- there 's a lot of of the city -- we we that they have found three of the . \n",

      "second , they need a lot of energy because because the surfaces are glass glass , the heat inside inside inside , and then you need lots of lots . \n",
      "in a city , not should n't happen to , because they have pretty weather that that 's been 25 to 20 to 25 25 . \n",

      "this is a place in a place called a rich culture and tradition . \n",

      "it has also this idea of space space that uses the uses - activity to create activity . \n",
      "so i thought , that 's exactly what i really want to design , not a a . . \n",
      "but the question was , how we could build a building , building building building with these principles . \n",
      "the next challenge came to when we were to this , because it 's in a a city town of the city , where most of the buildings you were sitting on the picture , there were n't there . \n",
      "it 's between two two two that have across a hundreds of meters . \n",
      "first first , we created a connection between these two streets , and then there all the <unk> of the building . \n",
      "this is a a - a - that that creates a a a that creates a building in the building itself itself its own shape and its sun and and . \n",
      "and to get this <unk> , we we the idea of a with a little with the little that that that in every every , because of the shape of the change , because of the change . \n",
      "i also think , how do we end up the building ? \n",
      "i wanted to really find a solution to go on the local . . \n",
      "i started thinking about think about how a a a concrete out of concrete with <unk> , which the air air , and light light , but in the form form . \n",
      "and then i this this new buttons in the the <unk> . . \n",
      "they have the properties of a a geometry , and that helped me to the entire entire . . \n",
      "we 're building this with little little little , , the windows that air air and light on the into the buildings . \n",
      "and that 's going through these little , , , the bits that light the light from the the of the to to to the building the building . \n",
      "it was n't just the the to to with ideas ideas , because they thought , \" this is not a not - shaped . that did n't have . \" \n",
      "but then we realized that we this idea of the the idea of the , is the idea of a idea of a , , because they can actually sell more more . \n",
      "the the concept of the was too much , much much much , not just because of the material compared , compared , but it because we because we had n't have a conditioning . \n",
      "so we created some <unk> - that we used to to project . \n",
      "the first time was to think about how to make the building building , in a city city , a city that almost almost almost every day . \n",
      "we created a call the , by by on the roof on the roof . \n",
      "and under this <unk> , , we we this this as a new space space with space and and , and that that this this this this . \n",
      "these these <unk> on the roof roof , the water to the into the . . \n",
      "hopefully hopefully at the next year , because we have the the to 5 . \n",
      "the second example is a <unk> - for for 2,000 in and in institutions . \n",
      "so to do a big project , the biggest project i 've ever been , , i had to understand the city of the city , but also the environment , the tradition , the tradition and the culture . \n",
      "and this analysis analysis analysis i i particular particular on the the , , which is the 1,000 - old structure that was from a wall , through 12 through , through and by the way . \n",
      "when i was to the the , the first step to to the the streets of the to create the first 12 of with with large size and and and like the in in and and other cities with these <unk> . \n",
      "so , we , we some some points points in the into the into the concept of this , and and they them with straight straight , and the changed the original pattern . \n",
      "the final step was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , as the as , as a a part of the . . \n",
      "what would the best best in in a a climate for a apartment ? \n",
      "this is <unk> , because of the <unk> between the between the between the two <unk> that created created created and a natural natural . . \n",
      "so we put a pattern about the the that that most of the most that are are in in this direction . \n",
      "and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european and and the arab city . \n",
      "there are the blocks with <unk> and and in the , , these are the these . \n",
      "it also also the local wall that would increase higher density in the upper and and a a density density in the . . \n",
      "it also also the concept of the . \n",
      "the volume has this shape form that has evolved through three different of of , , and also to very dense light light into the ground , , there are three different of , , like a a and a kindergarten and and a nearby of a of the that\n",
      "the roof , my my project in this project , the community 's almost almost the space to the building . \n",
      "there can all all neighbors and and and and make things , like a a a on the morning , a a building to a building . \n",
      "these two examples have made a common approach of the . \n",
      "they 're in emerging where you can see the cities literally literally . \n",
      "in in cities cities changes changes changes the architecture of architecture in the and and future future of people people local local communities and and as as as as as buildings . \n",
      "and that reason , it 's important to architecture , architecture , but but solutions solutions solutions that are the the relationship between the community and the environment and the to to it and and to connect . \n",

      "we 're other in between the way , the the the the almost almost almost almost in the middle . \n",
      "but is that a good proof ? \n",
      "<unk> - -- -- -- -- . \n",
      "what could you be that ? \n",
      "so you look at the general people of people people when you 're going to be certain questions . \n",
      "trust trust politicians ? trust trust ? \n",

      "trust trust it 's ? \n",
      "trust trust it 's ? \n",

      "it 's rational . \n",
      "in short , we 're in in short short , we 're trust in different ways . \n",
      "we do n't think of it that we every every or a a or or a in in an inner . . \n",
      "so i could say about that i i was given a particular , , , , , first grade , the first class , the , class , but i would n't want to go to the . . \n",

      "i 'm that my my friend friend a a a on a , , but maybe not that she 's a secret secret . \n",
      "simple . \n",

      "the the situation are doing a very bad thing about the actual , , because they ignore the sense of the that you 're in the . . \n",
      "second , , we get to . \n",

    "The baseline requires us to fix the attention module. To be specific, we take a probability distribution (softmax) over the hidden states of the encoder. calcAlpha returns the alpha vector which is the softmax and tanh applied to our score in alpha = torch.nn.functional.softmax(self.V_att(torch.tanh(scores)), dim=1). The scores are the encoder hidden state added by decoder hidden state in scores = self.W_enc(encoder_out.permute(1, 0, 2)) + self.W_dec(decoder_hidden.permute(1, 0, 2)). forward returns the context vector which is the sum of alpha vector weights multiplied by the decoder hidden state for each source side index with context = (torch.sum(alpha.permute(1, 0, 2) * encoder_out, dim=0)).reshape(1, 1, dim). self.W_enc, self.W_dec, and self.V_attr holds the hidden states and scores to the Torch linear layers. The attention output mostly contains information from the hidden states that received high attention. Attention mechanism can improve the score because it is developing a context vector. The context vector can be filtered specifically for each output time step. \n",

      "and when we hear the word first , we 've got this whole word with the word and it later . \n",
      "and the secret of what 's going on , and the secret , to be able to look better out of a way to put the names of the into the state -- one information that has no connected to meaning in meaning in a sense way and meaning\n",
      "one of the techniques can make two 500 years back to the the . \n",
      "she was known as the the . \n",
      "the story of his story is like : there was a poet called the who a the . \n",
      "he was interested in the conversation , because at the time , if you wanted to make a really big party , you would not have a the , but a poet . \n",
      "he carries his poem in the front and front of the room , and the right now , exactly the moment came up with me and all the . \n",
      "not 's not only all the dead , their bodies are up to the the . \n",
      "no one can tell anyone who was there , nobody knows where who has . \n",
      "the body can not be properly . \n",
      "it 's an tragedy after the other . \n",
      "the stands , outside , the only actor of this disaster -- he 's his eyes , and he 's got to see him in front of his eye , where . \n",
      "and so he takes the the in the hand , and it causes the to the . \n",
      "in this moment , something that we all know all know that we do n't matter how much we , or the , of our colleagues , we have a very good and memory . \n",
      "i would like to ask you to tell you the first 10 words to tell you about how you find it hard to find it hard to find it hard . \n",
      "but i bet if you ask you to remember who in this moment on a moment on a the horse in your stomach , you might have the . \n",
      "so the idea of the is to create a building of the eye , and it with the images of things -- the dark , the -- the , the , the , the , the picture of the as it . \n",
      "this is a advice that goes back on over 2,000 years old , about the memory . \n",
      "so how does it work ? \n",
      "now , you 're invited to talk to you about ted talk , and you hold it out of memory , just as the would have done , he would have taken over the years ago . \n",
      "you 'd like that way : you imagine your . \n",
      "imagine a secret - crazy and crazy story with the images , to remind you that you were first to talk about these crazy talks . \n",
      "and then you go into your house and you see the noise on the back of the . \n",
      "and that would remind you your friend ed . \n",

      "you go into your kitchen , and the fourth thing that you 're talking about , was the strange journey to you for a year , and you 've got some friends to help you to remind you . \n",
      "so it turns out to the out of their -- not a word , which is confused , but subject for topic . \n",

      "at the age of 27 , i got a job in the the for a the . \n",
      "public schools in new york , i started to the . \n",
      "like every teacher , i led to tests and . \n",
      "i was homework . \n",
      "when the work works , i grades notes . \n",

      "after a couple of years in school , i came to conclusion that we were able to understand a much better understanding for students and learning from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective . \n",
      "what do we do in the best measure is the benefits . but what happens if school in school and life lives much more than the ability and easy to learn ? easy ? \n",
      "so i left the classroom , and a to . \n",
      "i started to kids and adults in all kinds of different situation , and i wondered who is successful and why ? \n",
      "my , and i went to the west institute . \n",
      "we were trying to predict what the would be , and would n't . \n",
      "we went to national and the to the children would go . \n",
      "we studied the that worked in very tough business , and asked them to teachers the teachers to the end of the , and they were able to improve their students of their students . \n",
      "we were partnerships with , and scientists , who are their of the . \n",
      "and who would make the money . \n",
      "so in all these different social systems , an individual as an act of success . \n",
      "it was not social intelligence . \n",

      "some time ago , i started working in public schools in chicago . \n",
      "i asked thousands of students at the bottom of the for the , and then wait to a year to see who was made . \n",
      "it turns out that kids with kids are even more difficult at the , even if i do all the kinds of things , things like the same results , results - tests , even as they did it in the school . \n",
      "so it does n't just work in the and , but also in school , especially for children . \n",
      "so the main thing about this topic is for me that we know so little that the science is so little about how to do it . \n",
      "every day , my parents ask me and teacher and said , \" how do we study the children of children ? \" \n",
      "how did i teach to see a ? \n",
      "how do i do it for ? \" \n",
      "the answer : i do n't know . \n",
      "what i know is that you 're not going to be done . \n",
      "our data show us that a lot of our people are not going to remain . \n",
      "in fact , surprisingly is not necessarily not necessarily not , but it 's also talent with talent . \n",
      "so far as the best idea that i 've been about the of , is called the . \n",
      "this idea has been involved at stanford university of research and the belief that the ability to learn is not , but that they can change their change . \n",
      "dr. the has shown that kids when you read about the brain and learn how it 's to answer to the challenges of challenges and , very much more likely because they do n't believe that failure is a state condition . \n",
      "this the posture is a great idea for the original . \n",
      "but we need more . we need more . \n",
      "i 'd like to finish my finish , because we are so far . \n",
      "that 's the work that lies us . \n",
      "we need to best our best ideas and narratives and . \n",
      "we have to do whether we have successful . we have to be willing to fail to failure , to have able to learn lessons and from . \n",
      "in other words , we need to be able to give our kids . \n",
      "thank you very much . \n",
      "in the center of my work is the connection of our lives and our part of the environment , architecture from the natural , local conditions , and traditions . \n",
      "today , i example , as an example of projects . \n",
      "both of projects are in emerging , one in ethiopia and one in tunisia . \n",
      "they also have common that the different from different perspectives are a different part of the brain . \n",
      "the first example started with an invitation , a the - in capital . \n",
      "this is the kind of building that we us , my team , and me , as an example of what we should be shown . \n",
      "first of all , i thought i wanted to . \n",
      "so after we 've seen a couple of these buildings -- there 's a lot of them in the city -- we realized that they 've found three . \n",
      "first of all , these buildings are very empty , because they 're very large , where people ca n't afford to buy things . \n",
      "second , they need a lot amount of energy because the surfaces are out of glass , which heat inside , and then you need lots of lots . \n",
      "in fact , in a city that should n't supposed to happen , because they 've pretty weather that 's about 25 to 20 to 25 . \n",
      "and thirdly , they have their with and ethiopia . \n",
      "this is a place in a place called a rich culture and tradition . \n",
      "and also , in the first , i was really working with the old market with the old market with this the center , where thousands of people go and , every day in day . \n",
      "it 's also this idea of space that uses the the to create activity . \n",
      "so i thought , this is exactly what i really want to design , not a mall . \n",
      "but the question was , how could we create a building , building buildings with these principles . \n",
      "the next challenge came to when we were doing this , because it 's in a proper town of the city , where most of the buildings you were sitting on the picture , there were not there . \n",
      "it 's between two that have hundreds of hundreds of meters . \n",
      "first , we created a connection between these two streets , and then there all the walls of the building . \n",
      "this is moving in a - the , which creates a building in the building which is itself through its own shape and its sun and rain . \n",
      "in order to get this the , we get the idea of a with a little that is moving in every , because of because of the shape of the change . \n",
      "i also think : how do we close the buildings ? \n",
      "i really wanted to find a solution in the local . \n",
      "i started thinking about how to think about how a out of concrete out of concrete , which air the air , and the light , but in the form . \n",
      "and then i called these beautiful buttons in the the . \n",
      "they have the characteristics of a geometry , and that helped me to the entire . \n",
      "we 're building it with these little bits , the windows , the air and air light into the buildings into the buildings . \n",
      "and this is going through these little , a little bits that takes the light from the use of the to building the building at the building . \n",
      "it was n't just the to with these ideas , because they thought , \" this is not a nuclear mall . we did n't have it . \" \n",
      "but then we realized that this idea of the is much more than the idea of a , because they can actually sell more . \n",
      "well , the concept of the was too much , much less . it 's not just because of its material compared with glass , but also because we do n't have any conditioning . \n",
      "so we created some the techniques that we used to use this project . \n",
      "the first time was to think about how we could make the building , in a city in a city that almost nearly a daily day . \n",
      "we created a call that we by on the roof on the roof . \n",
      "and under those the , we put it as the as a new public space with space and , and that this . \n",
      "these on the roof on the roof collect the water into the camps . \n",
      "hopefully at the beginning of the next year , because we 've got the down to 5 . \n",
      "the second example is an the example of 2000 in russia and institutions in the . \n",
      "so to make a big project , the biggest project i 've ever designed , i had to understand the city of the city , but also the environment , the tradition , the tradition and the culture . \n",
      "during this analysis , i 'm particularly specifically to the , which is the 1,000 - old - old structure that was a by a wall , through 12 , and through by the lines . \n",
      "when i went to the site , the first step to create the existing streets to create the first 12 blocks , with the size of the size and properties like the in cities and in other cities with cities . \n",
      "in addition , we some points in the into the into the concept of the , and it with straight lines , and that changed the original pattern . \n",
      "the last step was to think about the cell , the little cell of the project , like the apartment , as a part of the the . \n",
      "what was the best in a the climate for a apartment ? \n",
      "this is the , because , because of the the between the two the that are created and created a natural design . \n",
      "so we put a pattern about the that most of the apartments are in this direction . \n",
      "and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european , and the arab city . \n",
      "there are the blocks with the and in the , there are all sorts of things . \n",
      "it also the local wall that produces the density into the upper and a density in the . \n",
      "it also the concept of the . \n",
      "the volume has this shape form , which has evolved through three different layers , and it into very dense light into the ground of the , there are three different institutions , like a and a kindergarten , and in a near a series of\n",
      "the roof , my the project on this project , the community 's almost to the space room from the building . \n",
      "there can all the neighbors and together , and make things like a the on the morning , from a building to another building . \n",
      "these two examples have created a common approach . \n",
      "they 're in emerging where you can see the cities literally . \n",
      "in these cities changes the changes of architecture in the and future of people the local communities and just as the buildings . \n",
      "from that reason , it 's important to architecture , architecture , but actual solutions that have the relationship between the community and the environment , and the it to nature and connecting . \n",
      "thank you very much . \n",
      "i want to talk about trust , and i want you to talk about the opinions . \n",
      "they 're so ubiquitous that they used to become the . \n",
      "there is one of my view of three . \n",
      "first of all : trust is faith in , many . \n",
      "then goal : we need to trust more confidence . \n",
      "and a task : we should be able to rebuild the confidence . \n",
      "i believe that the claim , the goal and the challenge is wrong on the wrong ideas . \n",
      "so i want to give you a different story about a claim , a goal and a to make a much better approach on the . \n",
      "first of the claim : why do people trust ? \n",
      "and when i really talk to my knowledge , i know , i do n't know the answer . \n",
      "maybe it has some in some common or institutions , or in some other . \n",
      "i did n't see me . \n",
      "but i course , i can look at the places that the are the source to believe that it 's a . \n",
      "if you look at a look at a period , it 's not a lot of . \n",
      "in some people , the people who were 20 years ago , mainly journalists and politicians , still the . \n",
      "and the people who been taught very 20 years ago , still very familiar : the , nurses , nurses . \n",
      "we 're different between the , by the way , the average citizens is almost right in the middle . \n",
      "but is that a good proof ? \n",
      "the the -- clear -- opinions . \n",
      "what could you do ? \n",
      "so they 're looking at the general mindset of people when you 're going to be certain questions . \n",
      "trust politicians ? trust they trust ? \n",
      "now , if you ask somebody asked , do you trust ? \n",
      "do you trust ? \n",
      "do you trust ? \n",
      "and then you would say , \" well ? \" \n",
      "and that would be a reasonable response . \n",
      "and if you understand the answer to you , you might say , \" i 'm not some of you , but not . \" \n",
      "absolutely rational . \n",
      "in short , we 're in our short lives , we 're trust in different ways . \n",
      "we do n't think of it that we have every heart or a in a or . \n",
      "so i could like to say that i was given a given , i , the first class , the first class , but i would n't want to drive the . \n",
      "maybe i know i know that it 's not going to be good car . \n",
      "and i realized that my friend had a conversation on running , but maybe not that they 're a secret . \n",
      "simple . \n",
      "so know how we know from our everyday ways , how different things look like , but why do n't we know this knowledge when we think about trust ? \n",
      "the , there 's a very bad thing about the actual , because they ignore the sense of the . \n",
      "second , we come to the goal . \n",
      "the goal is to trust more confidence . \n",
      "honestly , i think that 's the stupid . \n",
      "i would n't do that . \n",
      "i would try to trust the more confidence , but not wo n't . \n",
      "i do n't even actively to trust . \n",
      "and for those , for example , your savings into the hands of a certain event who would like to say the , \" the , \" , \" i , \" i think , too much . \n",
      "\" trust is no the goal in this life . \n",
      "trust and should be the goal . \n",
      "and then you say , yeah , ok , what is the most important , is not trust , but . \n",
      "the people from humans . \n",
      "and to do that , we need to look at three things . \n",
      "are you ? are you honest ? are you ? \n",
      "when we talk a person in the topics , and , then we have a good reason to trust their confidence , it 's be . \n",
      "it 's not the person , but it 's probably not . \n",
      "some of my friends are friends and honest , i would n't give you a letter , because they are the . \n",
      "i have friends that are very different in their own , but that 's what they do . \n",
      "and i 'm very happy about that i did not have a lot of friends that are and , but the . \n",
      "if you know , i did n't have it . \n",
      "but after that , we look forward , then , trust . \n",
      "trust is the response . \n",
      "so we have to do that , of course , that 's hard . \n",
      "over the last decades , we 've been trying to tackle up with all sorts of treatments and experts and experts and that make it easier to save their lives . \n",
      "many lot of these systems have the effect . \n",
      "they do n't work like . \n",
      "a the said once said to me , \" the problem is that the is no longer going to take the baby to the world . \" \n",
      "everywhere in our public lives , in our institutions in our institutions , state of this problem , and this need to stop and , but to the opposite . \n",
      "it 's people like the people from their tasks , by taking them . \n",
      "now , anybody can any examples . \n",
      "so that 's the goal . \n",
      "the goal is more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to be , and want to communicate to other , and if we want to whether other people , or politicians , politicians . \n",
      "it 's not easy . you 've got to do it . simple reactions or does n't matter . \n",
      "and now up to task . \n",
      "this as an actor of the describe to describe the . \n",
      "because it suggests that they should and i trust . \n",
      "we can do that for ourselves for ourselves . \n",
      "we can win a little bit . \n",
      "so 's how two people can improve your confidence . \n",
      "but ultimately , it 's self - confidence that it 's being done by another . \n",
      "you ca n't do it again what else is going to give . \n",
      "you have to give them to give you a trust . \n",
      "so you have to be smart . \n",
      "and of course , of course , is that you do n't usually get people all at the nose at the nose . \n",
      "but they also have to get older that they 're trustworthy . \n",
      "how does this ? \n",
      "that 's happening every day , everywhere . normal people do doing , very effective . \n",
      "here 's a simple example . \n",
      "the store , where i bought my neck , she me up , and they ask no questions . \n",
      "they take them back and give me back to me , or a couple of the in the . \n",

      "they had never really thought about that business . \n",
      "they thought to work for a work , or for government , but that story , its innovation , had a strong impact on them . \n",

    "We implement beam search to get approximate global optimal instead of local optimal in greedy search. The idea is: at each step, keep track of the k most probable partial translations (the top-k log probabilities). When the path with the best score is found, we backtrack along the path and output the whole sentence. This was shown in the beamDecoder function, where we create nodes containing the parent, log prob score, word, and hidden decoder and push them on the queue. The top-k probable partial translations will be added to the queue. We get the node with the best score then backtrace by traversing through the node's parents until there are no more nodes left to traverse and apply transformations to get the best word sequence for the outputs array.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hoever, we found there were many 'unk' words in the text. It's hard to sparse them. The simple method we implemented was to replace \"unk\" with \"the\" that is the most common word in English. After that, we got score 18.3882. The replacement was shown in the translate function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "After our analysis, we thought k was still too small here and it should be larger. After tuning the value of k several times, we determined that k=40 in our implementation. Another important thing we did was to remove repeated words (also shown in the translate function). Eg. \"beauty beauty\" => \"beauty\".\n",

    "When we finished these improvements, the final BLEU score is 20.1022.\n",
