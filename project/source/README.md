In source folder, there are some .py files and .ipynb file. Our .py files contain the main code
of models. You can run .py files, it would generate .csv files but it won't show you evaluation. 
We wrote our evaluation code in .ipynb files. For project.ipynb, it would explain our main
implementation ideas in details, but you can not run it. If you want to test each model, you 
can run its own .ipynb file, which would show you entire results. Note that before you run .ipynb 
files, you have to download all data and create a data folder OUTSIDE the source folder. Here is the 
link for data: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fV7vJuCoOaZZDDYMgQ3zEcoChyN3WnPx?usp=sharing
To run the codes, please put "train.csv", "test.csv" and "glove.6B.100d.txt" in `data/`
And also, this link provides with our output csv files.
